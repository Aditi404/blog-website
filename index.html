            <h1>My first month in my college</h1>
            <p>When I got to know that finally my college was going to open I was very happy.<br> As after a long wait of over  half a month my college was going to open. </p>
            <p>I was so excited as I was going to make new friends meet new peoples from different places of Bihar(Yes It was a Bihar state engineering college as I was unable to grab a seat in NITs IITs)</p>
            <p>Before opening of my college I contacted so my people of college some good some bad. But the most unexpected was a senior. She gave me a hope that being from a tier 3 college I can also achieve something big,She gave a hope in me. Now coming to the first month I made many friends in my college. Got to know about different personalities of person. My college in on highway whenever I looked on the highway I alaways remember the story of Rohan Kamath a qquora writer(Yes I love reading quora stories). I got room alloted in my hostel behind my hostel is a Shiv Mandir it is so sooting to look at the mandir it gives you inner peace. We celebrated holi with a lot of enthusiasm. I have never celebrated holi like this it was a awesome expirience. from everyone college you learn new things. This all for todays blog I will be posting more. </p>
